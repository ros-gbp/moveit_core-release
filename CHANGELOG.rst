* Added new virtual getName function to constraint samplers for easier debugging and plugin management
* KinematicsMetrics no longer crashes when called with non-chain groups.
* Added doxygen for RobotState::attachBody() warning of danger.
* resolve full path of fcl library
  Because it seems to be common practice to ignore ${catkin_LIBRARY_DIRS}
  it's more easy to resolve the full library path here instead.
* Fix fcl dependency in CMakeLists.txt
  See http://answers.ros.org/question/80936 for details
  Interestingly collision_detection_fcl already uses the correct
  variable ${LIBFCL_LIBRARIES} although it wasn't even set before
